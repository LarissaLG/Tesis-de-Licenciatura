The theory of ellipsoidal harmonics, originated in the nineteenth century, could only be seriously applied with the kind of computational power available in recent years. This, therefore, is the first book devoted to ellipsoidal harmonics. Topics are drawn from geometry, physics, biosciences and inverse problems. It contains classical results as well as new material, including ellipsoidal bi-harmonic functions, the theory of images in ellipsoidal geometry and vector surface ellipsoidal harmonics, which exhibit an interesting analytical structure. Extended appendices provide everything one needs to solve formally boundary value problems. End-of-chapter problems complement the theory and test the reader's understanding. The book serves as a comprehensive reference for applied mathematicians, physicists, engineers and for anyone who needs to know the current state of the art in this fascinating subject.},

Current methods for discriminating lymphocyte cell types primarily rely on labelling techniques with magnetic beads or fluorescence agents, which take time and have costs for sample preparation and may also have a potential risk of altering cellular functions. Here, we present the identification of non-activated lymphocyte cell types at the single-cell level using refractive index (RI) tomography and machine learning. From the measurements of three-dimensional RI maps of individual lymphocytes, the morphological and biochemical properties of the cells are quantitatively retrieved. To construct cell type classification models, various statistical classification algorithms are compared, and the k-NN (k = 4) algorithm was selected. The algorithm combines multiple quantitative characteristics of the lymphocyte to construct the cell type classifiers. After optimizing the feature sets via cross-validation, the trained classifiers enable identification of three lymphocyte cell types (B, CD4+ T, and CD8+ T cells) with high sensitivity and specificity. The present method, which combines RI tomography and machine learning for the first time to our knowledge, could be a versatile tool for investigating the pathophysiological roles of lymphocytes in various diseases including cancers, autoimmune diseases, and virus infections.},

	abstract = {Optical property measurements on blood are influenced by a large variety of factors of both physical and methodological origin. The aim of this review is to list these factors of influence and to provide the reader with optical property spectra (250–2,500 nm) for whole blood that can be used in the practice of biomedical optics (tabulated in the appendix). Hereto, we perform a critical examination and selection of the available optical property spectra of blood in literature, from which we compile average spectra for the absorption coefficient (μ(a)), scattering coefficient (μ(s)) and scattering anisotropy (g). From this, we calculate the reduced scattering coefficient (μ(s)′) and the effective attenuation coefficient (μ(eff)). In the compilation of μ(a) and μ(s), we incorporate the influences of absorption flattening and dependent scattering (i.e. spatial correlations between positions of red blood cells), respectively. For the influence of dependent scattering on μ(s), we present a novel, theoretically derived formula that can be used for practical rescaling of μ(s) to other haematocrits. Since the measurement of the scattering properties of blood has been proven to be challenging, we apply an alternative, theoretical approach to calculate spectra for μ(s) and g. Hereto, we combine Kramers–Kronig analysis with analytical scattering theory, extended with Percus–Yevick structure factors that take into account the effect of dependent scattering in whole blood. We argue that our calculated spectra may provide a better estimation for μ(s) and g (and hence μ(s)′ and μ(eff)) than the compiled spectra from literature for wavelengths between 300 and 600 nm.},
