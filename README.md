# Numerical calculation of optical properties of healthy and diseased erythrocytes

**Description:**  
The study of the optical properties of biological cells such as osteoblasts, lymphocytes, and erythrocytes is important in the medical field due to its potential applications in the diagnosis and early detection of diseases. In particular, erythrocytes have been reported to exhibit alterations in their composition and morphology in various forms of anemia, which directly affects their optical response . The optical response of erythrocytes is modified by factors such as hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, and oxygen saturation level [3], which modify their dielectric function and geometry, in turn changing their light absorption and scattering mechanisms. Therefore, the main objective of student Dana Larissa's undergraduate thesis is to characterize the optical properties of both healthy and diseased erythrocytes, considering variations in their dielectric function and morphology.

To this end, the spectral response of erythrocytes is quantified by calculating the extinction, scattering, and absorption cross sections using the finite element method (FEM).
During the course of this work, the student will address three main topics. In the first area, they will delve into the most common pathologies affecting erythrocytes. In the second area, they will become familiar with the analytical solution known as Mie theory, as well as the Kramers-Kronig relations to determine the dielectric function of the erythrocytes in question. Finally, on the third axis, we will numerically calculate the optical response, light scattering, and absorption, for erythrocytes using the FEM implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics and geometries designed in SolidWorks.
