\section{Esparcimiento por una part√≠cula aislada}
\label{section:yth}


Consider an arbitrary particle that is illuminated by a plane harmonic wave
(Fig. 3.3). The direction of propagation of the incident light defines the z axis,
the forward direction. Any point in the particle may be chosen as the origin 0
of a rectangular Cartesian coordinate system (x, y, z), where the x andy axes
are orthogonal to the z axis and to each other but are otherwise arbitrary. The
orthonormal basis VeCtOrS ex, ey, ez are in the directions of the positive X, y,
and z axes. The scattering direction er and the forward direction ez define a
plane called the scattering plane
