The theory of ellipsoidal harmonics, originated in the nineteenth century, could only be seriously applied with the kind of computational power available in recent years. This, therefore, is the first book devoted to ellipsoidal harmonics. Topics are drawn from geometry, physics, biosciences and inverse problems. It contains classical results as well as new material, including ellipsoidal bi-harmonic functions, the theory of images in ellipsoidal geometry and vector surface ellipsoidal harmonics, which exhibit an interesting analytical structure. Extended appendices provide everything one needs to solve formally boundary value problems. End-of-chapter problems complement the theory and test the reader's understanding. The book serves as a comprehensive reference for applied mathematicians, physicists, engineers and for anyone who needs to know the current state of the art in this fascinating subject.},

Current methods for discriminating lymphocyte cell types primarily rely on labelling techniques with magnetic beads or fluorescence agents, which take time and have costs for sample preparation and may also have a potential risk of altering cellular functions. Here, we present the identification of non-activated lymphocyte cell types at the single-cell level using refractive index (RI) tomography and machine learning. From the measurements of three-dimensional RI maps of individual lymphocytes, the morphological and biochemical properties of the cells are quantitatively retrieved. To construct cell type classification models, various statistical classification algorithms are compared, and the k-NN (k = 4) algorithm was selected. The algorithm combines multiple quantitative characteristics of the lymphocyte to construct the cell type classifiers. After optimizing the feature sets via cross-validation, the trained classifiers enable identification of three lymphocyte cell types (B, CD4+ T, and CD8+ T cells) with high sensitivity and specificity. The present method, which combines RI tomography and machine learning for the first time to our knowledge, could be a versatile tool for investigating the pathophysiological roles of lymphocytes in various diseases including cancers, autoimmune diseases, and virus infections.},

	doi = {10.1007/s10103-013-1446-7},
	abstract = {Optical property measurements on blood are influenced by a large variety of factors of both physical and methodological origin. The aim of this review is to list these factors of influence and to provide the reader with optical property spectra (250–2,500 nm) for whole blood that can be used in the practice of biomedical optics (tabulated in the appendix). Hereto, we perform a critical examination and selection of the available optical property spectra of blood in literature, from which we compile average spectra for the absorption coefficient (μ(a)), scattering coefficient (μ(s)) and scattering anisotropy (g). From this, we calculate the reduced scattering coefficient (μ(s)′) and the effective attenuation coefficient (μ(eff)). In the compilation of μ(a) and μ(s), we incorporate the influences of absorption flattening and dependent scattering (i.e. spatial correlations between positions of red blood cells), respectively. For the influence of dependent scattering on μ(s), we present a novel, theoretically derived formula that can be used for practical rescaling of μ(s) to other haematocrits. Since the measurement of the scattering properties of blood has been proven to be challenging, we apply an alternative, theoretical approach to calculate spectra for μ(s) and g. Hereto, we combine Kramers–Kronig analysis with analytical scattering theory, extended with Percus–Yevick structure factors that take into account the effect of dependent scattering in whole blood. We argue that our calculated spectra may provide a better estimation for μ(s) and g (and hence μ(s)′ and μ(eff)) than the compiled spectra from literature for wavelengths between 300 and 600 nm.},

Furthermore, the optical behavior of PLTs and red blood cells suspended in plasma are compared with those suspended in saline solution. Cell-free plasma shows a higher scattering coefficient and anisotropy factor than expected for Rayleigh scattering by plasma proteins. The scattering coefficient of PLTs increases linearly with the PLT concentration. The existence of physiological concentrations of leukocytes has no measurable influence on the absorption and scattering properties of whole blood. In summary, red blood cells predominate over the other blood components by two to three orders of magnitude with regard to absorption and effective scattering. However, substituting saline solution for plasma leads to a significant increase in the effective scattering coefficient and therefore should be taken into consideration.},

	abstract = {The direct usage of the Kramers–Kronig (KK) relations is complicated by two factors: limited frequency range of the available spectra and experimental errors. Here, we reconsider the application of the KK relations to experimental data for the construction of a self-consistent set of optical constants over a wide spectral range: the real part of the complex optical constant, F1, is reconstructed using the imaginary part F2, obtained from an experiment. The focus is on multiply (Q-)subtractive KK relations, which in contrast to the standard KK transformation, exploit information about F1 at a certain number Q of anchor frequencies. We develop a general mathematical framework of the Q-subtractive KK relations and analyze all sources of errors contributing to the inaccuracy of the reconstructed F1. We show that for the reconstruction of F1 only a single evaluation of the standard KK relation is needed together with a correction term given by an approximate evaluation of the error in the standard KK. It is demonstrated that in the classical form of the Q-subtractive KK relations, this correction term coincides with the Lagrange interpolation polynomial of the error with nodes at the anchor frequencies. Another correction term can also be constructed as a lower degree polynomial through a least squares fit, a particular realization of which is taking the average of Q singly subtractive KK relations. As a result, recommendations for the application of Q-subtractive KK relations are given. The accuracy of the considered approaches is illustrated on synthetic examples and experimental data of fused SiO2.},
